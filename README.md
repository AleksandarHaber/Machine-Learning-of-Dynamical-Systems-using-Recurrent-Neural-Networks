# Machine Learning of Dynamical Systems Using Recurrent Neural Networks

This project deals with learning to reproduce the input-output behavior of state-space models using recurrent neural networks and the Keras machine learning toolbox.

- The file "system_identification_machine_learning.py" is the main file. You should start from here.
- The file "backward euler.py" defines a function for discretizing the continuous-time system using the backward Euler method. It is called from the file "system_identification_machine_learning.py". The complete description of this project is given on my webpage: https://aleksandarhaber.github.io/
